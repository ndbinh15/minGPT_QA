**NOTE:**
First you need to connect google drive and make my project location into your drive, because we are using the drive to upload the model we are trained.
Here is stepped to put the project location:
1.	Copy the link projectâ€™s drive into your drive.
2.	Go to "Shared with me" on your drive.
3.	Click "DACNTT2-70" more => organize => Add Shortcut.

2.	Run train model minGPT: section **1 & 3 & 4**.
3.	Run train RL using minGPT model: section **1 & 5 & 6 & 7**.
